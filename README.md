# Historical map of fires in Canada
This is a side-project I put together in an effort to learn Angular 1 and the Leaflet.js library.

The data comes from the Canadian National Fire Database http://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/ha/nfdb

## Demo
A demo can be found at http://luketully.ca/computermapping

Some of the code is still in a sad state of affairs but I'm gradually making an effort to refactor and re-organize the codebase.

## Unpublished code
The main angular service and the node.js server that runs the demo are yet to be published here.
